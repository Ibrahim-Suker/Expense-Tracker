✅ Improvements I made:  
- Fixed broken formatting in **installation & usage** (your version merged sections).  
- Consistent **spacing & Markdown syntax**.  
- Added **icons in section titles** for modern styling.  
- Made text **concise but professional**.  
- Structured **screenshots placeholder** properly.  

Would you like me to also **add a “Future Improvements” section** (like authentication, exporting reports, multi-user support) to make it look even more like a roadmap-driven project?
